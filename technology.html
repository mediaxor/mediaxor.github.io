				<p class="para">Embedded software is any computer software which plays an integral role in the electronics with which it is supplied. It can be any code, which interacts with the hardware layer, ranging from the hardware abstraction layer, device drivers, kernel programming to application programming. Telecom, wireless products and consumer electronic products are major verticals in terms of revenue for the embedded software industry. Handheld devices, home multimedia and security systems in consumer electronic segments continue to drive momentum in the embedded multimedia industry.</p>
				<!-- p class="para">True multimedia is one of the most difficult fields of research because it  needs significant knowledge of many discplines. Over last few years, multimedia research has received tremendous attraction from industry due to its widespread reach. The quickly growing pervasiveness of multimedia increases the relevance of its knowledge for computer science and software engineering students. We look at some areas of multimedia applications beyond the general entertainment perception.</p-->

				<h4>Multimedia in defence and space applications</h4>
				<div class="tech_para">
					<p class="para">Secure communications is the most widely used technology in modern defence systems. Whether it is capturing of battlefield images on ground or from satellites, these images and videos are transfered to a location for rela time processing to extract battlefield information. Communicating instructions to troops , sending messages, video and voice conferencing are very commonly used applications of multimedia in defence. In deep space explorations, multimedia applications find tremendous importance. From capturing high quality images to capturing sound in space, multimedia analysis is a potent tool for space research. Undergoing research in the area of future image predicition is beneficial for defence where they can predict battlefield changes in real time.</p>

				<h4>Multimedia in education and sports</h4>
				<div class="tech_para">
					<p class="para">Education is perhaps the most benefitted area of multimedia applications yet it is an active area of research. Technologies like virtual classrooms and video conferencing are making distance learning a rewarding experience. Digitization of books and content has widespread access and is an active area of research for content protection. Interactive media plays a significant role in imparting quality education to kids and adults. In sports, multimedia applications are widely used for training purposes. Technologies such as multiview recording help to review player position and forms in a 360 degree view. Such techniques have helped raised competitiveness in sports and made it more thrilling experience to watch.</p>
