			<h2>Embedded Software Industry</h2>
			<p class="para">Globally, the embedded market is evolving rapidly with systems becoming more sophisticated and software workloads increasing in computational size as well as complexity. Global addressable market for embedded software and services is likely to reach up to USD 480 billion by 2025. Consumer electronics design continues to drive the need for higher performance, low power processors to be delivered to the market in shortest possible time. Today, extensive use of microprocessors, hardware accelerators and sensors within industries such as automotive, aviation, manufacturing and health care has thrown up immense potential for embedded products. High domestic demand also provides strong argument for key stakeholders to contribute in the growth momentum of this industry.</p>
			<p class="para">Embedded software is any computer software which plays an integral role in the electronics with which it is supplied. It can be any code, which interacts with the hardware layer, ranging from the hardware abstraction layer, device drivers, kernel programming to application programming. Telecom, wireless products and consumer electronic products continue to be major verticals in terms of revenue for the embedded software industry. Handheld devices, home multimedia and security systems in consumer electronics segments continue to drive this industry. Indian vendors are investing and building competencies around new verticals which are set to grow considerably in next few years.</p>

				<h4><span>Embedded Software</span></h4>
				<p class="para">Growing consumer market is creating a need for localised product features, resulting in increased activity in the embedded software development domain. Multiple embedded processors in SoCs with independent functions are being adopted in electronic devices. While chip designing companies largely work on the hardware abstraction layer and device driver layer of the embedded software, they are also adapting to open source platforms such as Android, which has given a boost to the embedded software industry. While some companies shorten time-to-market by switching to open source platforms, others prefer to grow their domain specific embedded software expertise in-house. The embedded software industry is expanding as third party service providers are moving up the value chain to offer more high value activities relating to middleware and driver design services.</p>

				<h4><span>Talent Pool Availability</span></h4>
				<p class="para">India is strongly poised in terms of current and future availability of engineering talent. India has highest number of engineering colleges as compared to other countries and leads in producing graduate engineers every year but the deficit of talent, skilled in relevant areas of engineering is sharply increasing. Fresh talent graduating from Indian universities are not readily deployable in industry and require a long lead tim to come to speed. While in terms of labour, more number of embedded software programmers are required for movement away from the hardware abstraction layer to the application layer, but in terms of complexity, multiple skill-sets are required on movement from the application layer to the hardware abstraction layer. In order to keep pace with the current technology which changes every few years, industry needs resources skilled in complex technologies. With inadequate research infrastructure facilities and university curriculum far meeting the industry requirements, a major challenge for industry is to find software engineers who can balance power and tight optimization in limited resource environment for specialised area of engineering.</p>
