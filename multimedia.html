				<p class="para">Multimedia is everywhere. Generally, the term multimedia is used for entertainment purpose only. For example, watching videos over Youtube, streaming movies over Netflix, streaming songs over Spotify or taking pictures in Instagram. However, multimedia finds its application in differenet areas including advertisement, education, publishing, business, medicine, art, engineering and research. In context of communication technology such as voip and video conferencing, multimedia is a field of specialisation in itself. Unfortunately, there is not much acceptance of multimedia as a discipline of engineering due to its entertainment aspect that hampers accepting it as a discipline of engineering in academics and industry.</p>
				<p class="para">True multimedia is one of the most difficult fields of research because it  needs significant knowledge of many discplines. Over last few years, multimedia research has received tremendous attraction from industry due to its widespread reach. The quickly growing pervasiveness of multimedia increases the relevance of its knowledge for computer science and software engineering students. We look at some areas of multimedia applications beyond the general entertainment perception.</p>

				<h4>Multimedia in defence and space applications</h4>
				<div class="tech_para">
					<p class="para">Secure communications is the most widely used technology in modern defence systems. Whether it is capturing of battlefield images on ground or from satellites, these images and videos are transfered to a location for rela time processing to extract battlefield information. Communicating instructions to troops , sending messages, video and voice conferencing are very commonly used applications of multimedia in defence. In deep space explorations, multimedia applications find tremendous importance. From capturing high quality images to capturing sound in space, multimedia analysis is a potent tool for space research. Undergoing research in the area of future image predicition is beneficial for defence where they can predict battlefield changes in real time.</p>

				<h4>Multimedia in education and sports</h4>
				<div class="tech_para">
					<p class="para">Education is perhaps the most benefitted area of multimedia applications yet it is an active area of research. Technologies like virtual classrooms and video conferencing are making distance learning a rewarding experience. Digitization of books and content has widespread access and is an active area of research for content protection. Interactive media plays a significant role in imparting quality education to kids and adults. In sports, multimedia applications are widely used for training purposes. Technologies such as multiview recording help to review player position and forms in a 360 degree view. Such techniques have helped raised competitiveness in sports and made it more thrilling experience to watch.</p>

				<h4>Multimedia in film and music production</h4>
				<div class="tech_para">
					<p class="para">Entertainment is one area where multimedia applications are most widely used. The rate of consumption of multimedia data is expected to grow multifold wih the availaility of affordable gadgets and internet connectivity. Consequently, there is a growing demand for quality content and bringing real life experiences to home. Film and music production are an active area of algorithmic research to innovate in audio video effect and graphic animation algorithms.</p>

			<div class="technology_list1">
				<h4>Multimedia in industrial automation and process control</h4>
				<div class="tech_para">
					<p class="para">Multimedia goes a long way in automating process and quality control for different industries. Industrial robots use image processing techniques for sorting and segregating of products. Image analysis application are used for grading of food products and other commodities. Image processing techniques are used to control quality of steel and enable robotic movements in the plants. </p>
